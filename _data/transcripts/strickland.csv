[00:00:00]  PART 1,,,
,DB:,"Well, let's put it right there.  And that one, it has like an auto level so that should work and I can see it.  So that's nice.  Usually I get really nervous about 30 minutes in.  Is it going?  One time, one wasn't going which really made me anxious.  That's why I have two.",
,SS:,So these are the questions?,
,DB:,"Yeah, these are the questions and it's pretty open-ended.  There are sort of a couple of parts to it.  The first part is the very sort of meant to be quickly going through your current practices for your digital files.  It's a survey that I've done online with a bunch of emerging writers and they are asking all the participants in this as well and then we'll talk kind of specifically about your writing process, which is probably the majority.  There are questions about computing and computers.  Usually we cover those but sometimes, I go through those a little bit too if we have gone through those things and I want to ask a few more.  Does that sound okay?  Do you have to go somewhere or anything?",
,,Everyone has been an hour 15 to an hour 45 right in there.  So if you would please state for the recording devices your name and our location.,
,SS:,"It's Stephanie Strickland, New York City.",location; technology
,DB:,"Okay.  In this section, I ask what you write and what you use to write it.  This is about how you compose currently.  What genres do you write in?",location; technology
,SS:,"I do books of poetry and I write critical essays, and I write and I make usually collaboratively born-digital works.",location; technology
,DB:,Okay.  Would you say you have a primary genre?,location; technology
,SS:,Poetry.,location; technology
,DB:,What kind of devices do you own or have access to for your writing?,
,SS:,"Pens, pencils.  I have four computing devices in this one room.  I keep an old XP Machine going, with difficulty these days.  I like the Word 2003.  I managed to get that and Word 2007 on that machine, and then I have a little small Acer, which is underneath there which is actually probably the most advanced, but again, it's Word 2007 is on there that I write with.  It's for travel and then since the last thing I made was app for iPad.  I was forced to buy an iPad, show the thing on.  So that's over there, a mini.",os; technology; style
,DB:,A mini?  That's what I have.,os; technology; style
,SS:,But I do not write on it.,os; technology; style
,DB:,"You don't write on it, right.",os; technology; style
,SS:,No.,os; technology; style
,DB:,Okay.  The operating systems you're using are mostly Windows.,os; technology; style
,SS:,XP and Windows 7.,os; technology; style
,DB:,"Do you work on the different devices and how do you work between like, I guess if you have all these devices, what is sort of your style for going between them?",os; technology; style
,SS:,"Well, when I'm generating new material, I will certainly do a certain amount of writing by hand.  I capture at various points the material in a Word processing program.  The one I work with most intuitively is Word 2003.  I'm annoyed at all the extra ridiculous functionality.",os; technology; style
,DB:,"At least there is no clippie, right?",
,SS:,"Yeah, I mean there's too much, it's not directed for what I want to do and it doesn't handle other things like Photoshop that it says there.",
,DB:,Yeah.,
,SS:,"But nonetheless, it's not supported anymore as with so much of the software that I once used.  So I capture it at different points, certainly capturing it online is much better for sharing it and editing it to a degree, but it's not particularly good for through line.",
,DB:,What do you mean by that?,
,SS:,"Well, if you're writing something long with a complex argument, I think it's a much easier trip to have it in front of you in paper and read it out because it's very easy to go into a collage and kind of style of stuff with stuff that's going to be published online.  It's harder to get a really long consecutive argument made I think or thought, and it's not fluid enough to do poetry.  I mean, it restricts you way too much in terms of formatting compared to what you can do on a page by hand in terms of how you want to scratch things out or put something right in there.",
[00:05:00],,,
,SS:,"There's no arrow, insert, none of that.  So it's neither -- so there's a little lost from both perspectives but obviously even from the point of organizing it and sharing it and necessarily sending it on for publishing these days and everything, it has to be done in... yeah, long, long ago, I get used to doing that.  It took me a long time to get there though because I started on a manual typewriter and then getting an IBM typewriter was a big thing, you know, I mean...",
